# Contributing

Please refrain from attempting to contribute without first reaching out to either the owner of this repository or someone who has long-standing contributions and addressing your ideas with them.

## Contributions we are looking for

This project will not require an expansive amount of documentation, but you may contribute it if you would like. The majority of the work needed will be Lua scripting for the addon and C++ coding for the log parsing. Tutorials for users that install the addon will not be needed, as the finished addon will most likely be added to a addon hosting website which installs them for you.

## Methods

Please use Github's pull request and issues features heavily for making contributions. These are by far the easiest way for you contributions to make it into the project. Feel free to branch, develop your own code, and then the owner of the repository will determine if your pull request is valid and helpful to the project. If you're not sure about if a certain addition will be helpful, feel free to ask.

## Contacting the owner/other developers

Please do not use the issue tracker to ask basic questions or inquire if your work is helpful. We can take these inquiries by email. Please email the owner at fakeemailnotreal@gmail.com.

## Expectations

Please do not submit code that would be considered a "hack." Please don't submit any code that isn't necessary or adds any extra features that you haven't contacted the owner about first. Try to refrain from adding any additional classes/files if they aren't needed. Please visit [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](https://github.com/paytonrog/CharacterTracker/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for the expectations our community has when interacting with each other.
