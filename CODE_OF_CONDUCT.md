# Code of Conduct

## 5 Tenets

Be kind to your fellow contributors. Just because they may be less knowledgable about the subject or code differently than you does not mean you should disparage them.

Be respectful of other's work. Do not replace or delete someone else's work unless you have a valid reason to. The best way to confirm that you have a valid reason to would be to use the issue tracker and confirm it with the community.

Be open to newcomers. We need as many people as we can to help us create the best tracker possible, so be open to explaining things or assisting others, even if it seems simple to you.

Disagree gracefully. There are many ways to code something correctly. Breaking out into an argument over which tiny detail is better than whatever other tiny detail does not help us in the long run. Be willing to let things go and offer compromises.

Watch your tongue. We would like this project to be veiwed favorably by all others, so please keep strong language in check, including anything inflammatory, harassing, or insults.
